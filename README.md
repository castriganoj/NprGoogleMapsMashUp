Welcome to the NPR Google Maps Mash up. 

This front end app uses javascript to call the npr api and return the current day's U.S. stories. The stories are held in an array of objects that hold the story's title, text, location, state name and geographic coordinates. When the npr api is called the title and text are set to their appropriate properties.  The app's logic then assigns a state name based on the text and then coordiantes are assigned based on the state name. 



This is an ongoing project. The final product will have a more reliable and percise way to assign a location. The UI will also allow for story topic filtering and date options. and there will be an area to read articles and link to the article at npr.org.
