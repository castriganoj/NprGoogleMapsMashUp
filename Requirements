            -City Name - npr api does not include city name. Next obstacle inculdes solution for city name. 
==>        City Name Algotherim
            Loop thru all text in story object
            Compare each word to array of of city names
                not sure where to get collection of cit names.

    Google Maps Api
        How to create marker with a city name
            Geolocation
                What is it and how to implement.
                More research needed. 
                
Iterations 

1. The first iteration will pull in npr api data and list out stories in custom format
        9/12/2015: done. 
     
2. Complete research on Google Maps API by reading documentation and placing marker on map using just a city name. 
        Set up and send geocode request for results that would return red and green results. 

3. Create City Name Algotherim
     9/13/2015:
    - Options
        Create array of us city names and match strings from article to array. Return one with highest count
        Send a geocode request for each string (preferred)
    Using 2nd method:
    - Algotherim Options
        Return first string that returns green
        Tags, title, categories,
         9/14/2015
         Based on research findings from npr api documentation, use:
            US and Text arguemnts in api call - http://api.npr.org/query?id=1003&fields=text&dateType=story&output=JSON&apiKey=MDE4OTM0NDk1MDE0Mjk3MDg1MDFhYjFiMg001
         loop thru text until a positive match is returned from geocode api
         Set up loop with fake geocode check (i.e. create string var with city name in test article and loop to match) 
            
         

4. Add city name to stories colelction and connect collection with geolocation

5. Finalize
