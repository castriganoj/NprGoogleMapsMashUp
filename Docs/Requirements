Iterations 

1. The first iteration will pull in npr api data and list out stories in custom format
        9/12/2015: done. 
     
2. Complete research on Google Maps API by reading documentation and placing marker on map using just a city name. 
        Set up and send geocode request for results that would return red and green results. 

3. Create City Name Algotherim
     9/13/2015:
    - Options
        Create array of us city names and match strings from article to array. Return one with highest count
        Send a geocode request for each string (preferred)
    Using 2nd method:
    - Algotherim Options
        Return first string that returns green
        Tags, title, categories,
         9/14/2015
         Based on research findings from npr api documentation, use:
            US and Text arguemnts in api call - http://api.npr.org/query?id=1003&fields=text&dateType=story&output=JSON&apiKey=MDE4OTM0NDk1MDE0Mjk3MDg1MDFhYjFiMg001
         loop thru text until a positive match is returned from geocode api. Create stories object with each story. properties for text, title and empty city name.  
         9/24/2015: 
            -Previos approach was not working. Geocoding approximates the search so it was returning results for words not realted to the stories location or a location at all like 'wednesday'.
            -New approach is to create word counts for the tag names. Then send word with highest count to geocode. 
                Began testing. Doesen't seem to work with title. No locations in title. This may work if the tag names were available but they dont seem to be. 
         9/28/2015
            -use 4th algotherim method in Docs/npt_api)notes.txt. 
         9/30/2015:
            -Need to review geolocation request. Pass results to location property in stories object. 
         10/1/2015:
            -stories object now has coordiantes in location property
         10/9/2015:
            -
         
4. Send each stirng to geolocation and check for match. 

5. Finalize
