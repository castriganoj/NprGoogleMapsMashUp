"title: "Authorities Search For Another Possible Victim In Utah Flash Floods"

""text: "A missing man's car was found Wednesday, badly battered, in a flood plain that had been hit by a flash flood. Police in Hurricane, Utah, say Ryan Mertlich may be yet another casualty of severe flooding that is known to have claimed 18 people.NPR's Howard Berkes reports for the Newscast desk:undefined"Searchers in Mohave County, Arizona, discovered the Geo Tracker belonging to Ryan Mertlich of Hurricane, Utah, in a dry wash that had carried a flash flood. But there's no sign of Mertlich, who typically travels the remote dirt roads of what is known as the Arizona Strip. A spokeswoman for the Mohave County sheriff says it's obvious that Mertlich's car was carried by a flash flood."The area is close to the Utah border about 15 miles west of Hildale, where a different flash flood Monday killed 12 people and left one missing. It's also far from Zion National Park, where seven hikers died in yet another flash flood."undefinedMohave County Arizona search teams were on the ground today looking for signs of the man, and Howard says, the search will continue tomorrow.Mertlich was reported missing on Tuesday after leaving Washington, Utah, and heading home on the remote dirt roads, which he knew well.Earlier this week, Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox called the floods "one of the worst weather-related disasters in the history of the state of Utah."

title: "Top FIFA Exec Suspended After Alleged World Cup Tickets Scheme"
cityName: ""
text: "FIFA announced today that it has suspended Secretary General J�r�me Valcke "until further notice," following allegations that he was involved in an operation to improperly profit from World Cup ticket sales.The world soccer governing body also said in the statement said it has requested a formal investigation by FIFA's Ethics Committee.The allegations against Valcke have been made by a consultant, Benny Alon, who worked for a company that at one point had a contract with FIFA to sell tickets for the 2014 World Cup, according to the Guardian.undefined"Documents seen by the Guardian appear to suggest that Valcke was to be the beneficiary of an agreement to sell the tickets at inflated prices. However the documents are incomplete, selective and could easily be open to other interpretations. One email from the consultant, Benny Alon, apparently sent to Valcke, states in reference to the sale of tickets to group matches at the 2014 World Cup: 'we made US$114,000 each on Germany.' However it has been suggested that no tickets were actually ever sold."undefinedValcke denies any wrongdoing.FIFA has been under global pressure for its alleged rampant corruption, which culminated in the indictment of 14 FIFA officials and the arrest of seven in May on charges including bribery, racketeering, money laundering and wire fraud. Valcke was not named in those documents, though he was accused of transferring $10 million as part of an alleged bribe to help South Africa win the right to host the 2010 World Cup. While he was not prosecuted in that instance, these newest allegations were enough to prompt FIFA to put him on leave. This action against Valcke, who was FIFA President Sepp Blatter's right-hand man since 2007, casts further suspicion on Blatter himself who has long been suspected of corruption.U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch also made waves in the soccer world this week when, during a trip to Zurich where FIFA is headquartered, she vowed to bring further charges against entities and individuals in relation to FIFA corruption.undefined"Separate and apart from the pending indictment, our investigation remains active and ongoing. It has in fact expanded since May. The scope of our investigation is not limited and we are following the evidence where it leads. We do anticipate pursuing additional charges against individuals and entities."undefinedMeanwhile, one of the seven officials arrested in May, Eugenio Figueredo, was just approved for extradition to the U.S. today, where he will face charges of accepting millions of d

The ambush-style murder of Sheriff Deputy Darren Goforth at a gas station in suburban Houston on Aug. 29 has added new urgency to warnings about a growing "war on cops" in America. After the arrest of the suspect, an African-American man named Shannon J. Miles, the local district attorney called for more public support for law enforcement."It is time for the silent majority in this country to support law enforcement," said Devon Anderson, the Harris County DA. "There are a few bad apples in every profession. That does not mean there should be open warfare declared on law enforcement."The notion of growing "warfare" against police stems in part from a statistical jump in the number of law officers murdered — "feloniously killed," in the jargon of the FBI's numbers.In 2014, the year of the Ferguson protests and increased media attention on police misconduct, 51 officers were killed nationwide. That was a jump from the 27 killed in 2013 and many took it as a sign of greater danger for police.Seth Stoughton, a former police officer and an assistant law professor at the University of South Carolina, calls that interpretation "nonsense.""It's misleading to compare one year to another year," he says.Stoughton has been collecting and analyzing these data going back decades. He says 2014 looked bad in comparison with 2013 mainly because 2013 was so good."2013 was the safest year for police officers, ever," he says. "The safest year in recorded history."In fact, in the larger scheme of things, 2014 looks pretty normal. The number of murders of police was about the same as 2012, and actually a lot lower than 2011.The long-term trend is even more encouraging: On average, only about half as many police are murdered every year now, as compared with the 1970s. Stoughton says some of that improvement is probably due to better training, better gear and radically improved trauma care for cops who are shot.But he says the numbers suggest officers are also facing fewer attacks: The number of assaults on police has also fallen, though not as sharply.Stoughton says he's not saying police work isn't dangerous — it certainly is. And he also admits we may be seeing a few more ambush killings — cops attacked just because they're cops.But it's hard to isolate motives in these numbers, and any uptick is probably in the single digits."When we're talking about 780,000 state and local police officers who are interacting with people on 67 million occasions every year, the increase from five to eight, or five to 10 — statistically, it doesn't look significant," he says.But statistical analysis is cold comfort to police officers after a colleague has been ambushed. Some officers have been understandably shaken.In a video that made the rounds soon after the Texas deputy was killed, a Miami officer named Lydia Marquez records herself in her car."When I kiss my children in the morning before I go to work, I don't know if I'm going to be coming back at the end of the day," she says. "Especially nowadays."Marquez ends her video defiantly, with the phrase that's become a rallying cry for many cops since Ferguson: "All lives matter. Everyone's life matters.""All lives matter" may sound noble, but activists hear it as code for something else."The way that people use the phrase is in direct opposition to 'Black Lives Matter,' " says Daunasia Yancey, a prominent member of the Black Lives Matter movement in Boston."I think that this 'war on cops' rhetoric is just another way to protect police from accountability," she says. "What they're facing is not violence; it's accountability."Soon after Goforth's murder, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick condemned what he called the "negative attitude" toward police. Accused of using the killing to shut down legitimate criticism of police, Patrick took aim at the media. On the public radio show Texas Standard, the host tried to ask him about all the recent videos showing police misconduct."Your type of interview has to stop," Patrick said."Yes, there are people in every profession who cross the line and should be fired," he continued. "Quit focusing on that small percentage of those in law enforcement who have made a mistake."Edward Conlon, a retired New York police detective who writes about police work, says his former colleagues feel unfairly judged by the mistakes of a few. He says they haven't seen evidence of a "war on cops," but they do feel embattled when it comes to public opinion."The notion that there is an epidemic of violence by police is just a really hard thing to swallow," he says.And he sees a parallel here. He thinks both sides are guilty of drawing dramatic conclusions from isolated cases."It's not even half right that cops are at war with black America, and it's not even half right that there's a war on cops, in any big or broad sense," Conlon says.But there does seem to be at least one kind of war going on: a war of perceptions, driven by competing feelings of grievance.
